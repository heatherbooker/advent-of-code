# advent of code

This repo is solutions and thoughts related to [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com), a cute series of programming problems that comes out with a new one every day-ish in december. 

I thought I'd give it a try to refresh my love for programming, and maybe help me learn something along the way.

It's not perfect code. Nothing ever is. :)
